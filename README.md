# Learning Unreal Engine: From Zero to Game Developer

Welcome! This repository is designed to teach you how to create games in Unreal Engine while building a strong foundation in programming and computer science. We believe in learning by doing, with clear explanations and minimal abstraction.

## Who This Is For

- Complete beginners who want to learn game development
- People curious about programming and how games work
- Anyone who learns best by understanding the "why" behind things

## What You'll Learn

1. **Setting Up Your Development Environment** - All the tools you need
2. **Programming Fundamentals** - How to think like a programmer
3. **Computer Science Concepts** - The building blocks of game development
4. **Unreal Engine Basics** - How the engine works
5. **Building a Simple Game** - Hands-on project from start to finish

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Your Tools (Do These In Order)

1. **[Windows Prerequisites](docs/setup/01-windows-prerequisites.md)** - Make sure Windows is ready
2. **[Unreal Engine](docs/setup/02-unreal-engine.md)** - Install the game engine
3. **[WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](docs/setup/03-wsl.md)** - Linux tools on Windows
4. **[Google Antigravity](docs/setup/04-antigravity.md)** - AI-powered code editor
5. **[Claude Code](docs/setup/05-claude-code.md)** - AI assistant for coding

### Step 2: Learn the Fundamentals

Work through the [fundamentals](docs/fundamentals/) section. Take your time - these concepts are the foundation everything else builds on.

### Step 3: Understand Computer Science Basics

The [computer science](docs/computer-science/) section explains how computers actually work. This knowledge helps you write better code and understand why Unreal does things certain ways.

### Step 4: Learn Unreal Engine

The [unreal](docs/unreal/) section teaches you how the engine is organized and how to think about game development.

### Step 5: Build Your Game

Follow along with the [simple game project](projects/simple-game/) to apply everything you've learned.

## Philosophy

### Why We Avoid Abstraction

Many tutorials hide complexity behind "magic" code. While this gets results faster, it doesn't teach you anything. When something breaks (and it will), you won't know how to fix it.

We show you what's actually happening. Yes, it takes longer. But you'll truly understand what you're building.

### Learning Is Not Linear

You'll read something, not fully understand it, move on, and then suddenly it clicks later. That's normal. Don't get stuck trying to perfectly understand everything before moving forward.

### Make Mistakes

The best way to learn is by breaking things. Try changing code to see what happens. The worst case is you undo your changes.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Edit code | Google Antigravity |
| Run Unreal | Epic Games Launcher |
| Command line tasks | WSL Terminal |
| Get help with code | Claude Code or Antigravity AI |

## Getting Help

- **Stuck on setup?** Each guide has troubleshooting sections
- **Code not working?** Use Claude Code to help debug
- **Concept confusing?** Re-read the relevant fundamentals section, or ask Claude Code

## Let's Begin
